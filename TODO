Remove the warning (at least from Readme and change it in docs)

# Implementation

The problems only arise with startTransition

1. do not support it
2. support it
   - we should check whenever a concurrent update is paused because of a sync one, and the restarted (should always restart).
   - This should implies Check some React internals, and may be too complex

testing with act Reactdom/TESTUTILS (TEST THAT STATE AND EFFECT/LAYOUTEFFECT WORKS PROPERLY)

master -> main

how to integrate with something like muuri react?

        A

    B        C            --->      it suspend with a transition  --->      D unmounts

    D      E     F


    We should rollback all data concerning D, it's work unit is not enough

I SUPPOSE EACH FIBER (WITH AN EFFECT) KEEPS TRACK OF THE NEXT ONE WITH AN EFFECT
SO TRY TO (AFTER CHECKING THE UNMOUNT ORDER REACT17):

1.  APPEND THE CHHILDREN TO UNMOUNT TO THE SILBLING OF THE UNMOUNTING PARENT
2.  DESIGN and TRY SOMETHING LIKE <UNMOUNTLISTENDER?>
3.  TRY TO LINK THE NEXT EFFECT ATTRIBUTE
