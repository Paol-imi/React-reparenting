title: Custom Renderer ðŸ”Œ
---

The default configuration is designed to work with ReactDOM.
If you want to try implementing React-Reparenting with other `renderers` you can try to `instruct` the package to manage the types of nodes you are working with, in order to automate the process as happens with ReactDOM.

```js
import { configure } from 'react-reparenting';

// The default configuration that works with ReactDOM.
configure({
  appendChildToContainer(container, child) {
    container.appendChild(child);
  },
  insertInContainerBefore(container, child, before) {
    container.insertBefore(child, before);
  },
  removeChildFromContainer(container, child) {
    container.removeChild(child);
  },
  isElement(elementType, stateNode) {
    return stateNode instanceof Element;
  },
});
```

If you have successfully implemented reparenting with React Native or with your custom renderer, feel free to share your solution by opening an issue on [Github](https://github.com/paol-imi/react-reparenting/labels/implementation%20%F0%9F%8E%89).
