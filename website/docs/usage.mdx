The key points to be followed to implement reparenting are explained below.

## Define your App

In each implementation you have to define mainly 3 things:

- What are the `Child` components that can be transferred.
- What are the `Parent` components that can hold these children.
- What are the components that will `trigger` reparenting.

Parent components will need some small setup, child components won't need it. Any component can be used as a child, however it is your responsibility to provide them with unique `keys` _(don't use [indexes as keys](https://medium.com/@robinpokorny/index-as-a-key-is-an-anti-pattern-e0349aece318))_.

:::tip
Note that a component can also have multiple roles.

## Send the children

This package offers more than one tool to manage reparenting, in each of them the procedure is always the same:

- Call a `send` method with the reparenting information.
- `Re-render` the components with the transferred Children in their new Parents.

<div align="center">
  <img src={useBaseUrl('images/code.png')} width="60%" />
</div>

<br />

That's all, the transferred components will not be re-mounted and will maintain their internal state.

By default the send method will also find and transfer `DOM nodes`. This option can be disabled so that you can manually send the nodes _(for example with drag and drop)_.

:::info
Note that the send method should only be called before re-rendering.

## Check the guide

Now you are ready to start. The component to interact with is the `<Reparentable>`, you can read the guide on how to use it [here](./reparentable).
